## Code for Efficient Vertical Federated Learning Method for Ridge Regression of Large-Scale Samples via Least-Squares Solution

The project is the code for the paper "Efficient Vertical Federated Learning Method for Ridge Regression of Large-Scale Samples via Least-Squares Solution".

In this project, we designed a simulation platform for federated learning and implemented our algorithm based on this platform.

### The software environment of the source code requires Java, eclipse and MATLAB 2017.

### Note: in order to run this project successfully, Matlab 2017 must be installed correctly!!!
